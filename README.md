 **Fundamental laws of software**

1. Conceiving The Purpose of Software
2. The Goals of Software Design
3.Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer.
4.Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity
5.Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming. 
6.There will always be some implementation of changes. Not only you have to implement them, but you also have to maintain them over time
7.f you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place <Consistency>
8. Prioritizing
(D): How much do you want that change to happen?
The value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?
The equation is simple: D=V/E
9. Solving Problems
The first step is understanding.
The second step is planning
The third step is dividing  Don’t try to solve one big problem

10.You can’t predict the future, so no matter how generic your solution is, it will not be generic enough to satisfy the actual future requirements you will have.
11.One of the great killers of a software project is assumptions
Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.
